					<h2>Painting Testimonial</h2>
					<p>
						We were selling our home and needed a room painted quickly. Pasha’s 
						team promptly came out and gave an estimate. It was quite reasonably 
						priced. They started and finished the very next day!—The Morris Family.

					<h2>Remodeling Testimonial</h2>
					<p>
						We needed to “undecorate” a room—the previous owners had been a little
						 too creative. Pasha’s team provided an estimate, promptly began work,
						  and within a few days our room was looking great!—The Felkes.
